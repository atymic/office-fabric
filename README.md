# Office UI Fabric Vue (WIP)
This is a WIP of Office UI Fabric Vue. It aims to use as much official `Office UI Fabric React` code as possible, by
re-using official files and packages.

# Important
This library is built on top of Microsoft's `office-ui-fabric-react`, more spefically the packages
`@uifabric/merge-styles`, `@uifabric/styling`, and `@uifabric/utilities`. For maximum design parity, office-fabric uses
`office-ui-fabric-react`'s component `.style.ts` definitions.

`@uifabric/merge-styles`, `@uifabric/styling`, `@uifabric/utilities` and the original `.style.ts` definitions of the
components are subject to Microsoft's license models. Please check `office-ui-fabric-react` for more information.

The `Vue`-components also borrow code from `office-ui-fabric-react`, making it easier to merge changes.

# Usage
The `website`-code is the best starting point if you want to see how components work. The documentation is still a WIP.
