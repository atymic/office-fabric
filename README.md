This library is built on top of Microsoft's `office-ui-fabric-react`, more
spefically the packages `@uifabric/merge-styles`, `@uifabric/styling`, and
`@uifabric/utilities`. For maximum design parity, office-fabric uses
`office-ui-fabric-react`'s component `.style.ts` definitions.

`@uifabric/merge-styles`, `@uifabric/styling`, `@uifabric/utilities` and the
original `.style.ts` definitions of the components are subject to Microsoft's
license models. Please check `office-ui-fabric-react` for more information.
